# ðŸ§© Boilerplate for React + Vite (with file-based routing) + TS + Tailwind

ðŸ’¡ How to use this boilerplate ?

## Custom File-based routing

I like Next.js file-based routing, but sometimes, I don't want all the Next.js features and I prefer classic Vite project. So I made a custom File-based routing with Vite.

Feel free to check it at `./src/context/FilebasedRouting.tsx`

I might update it in the future, or export it to a standalone package if it becomes too complex.
